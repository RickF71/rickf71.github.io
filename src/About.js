                <h3>About Me</h3>

                <p>Hi there! My name is Richard Fleischman and I'm the owner and creator of this website.
                 On this site, you'll find information about me personally, as well as my interests 
                 in computer programming.</p>

                <h3>Biography</h3>

                <p>I grew up in Franklin, WI, a suburb of Milwaukee, and attended the Milwaukee School 
                of Engineering (MSOE) where I studied Computer Engineering. While I have several 
                years towards my degree, I am also self-taught in many programming languages and
                 technologies. In my spare time, I enjoy programming, gaming, riding my bicycle, and cooking.</p>

                <h3>Professional Experience</h3>

                <p>I have several years of experience working as a programmer, and have gained expertise 
                in a variety of programming languages and technologies. Some of my notable achievements 
                include teaching part of a Full Stack Developer course and converting a web site from 
                PHP/HTML to an IBM Portal. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, 
                and I'm excited to share my knowledge and skills with my readers.</p>

                <h3>Contact Me</h3>
